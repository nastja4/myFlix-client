# myFlix React App

Welcome to the myFlix React app project! This is a client-side application built to complement the existing server-side code (REST API and database) of the myFlix movie app. Representing the integration of server-side functionality with a dynamic and responsive client-side interface, this project showcases the full-stack JavaScript technologies within the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). 
The app allows users to access information about movies, create profiles, and save their favorite movies.

## Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a single-page, responsive web app using React that allows users to access information about movies, create profiles, and interact with the server-side via REST API endpoints. The app aims to provide a rich user experience through various interface views and features, facilitating interactions with the myFlix server-side.

## Features

### Essential Views & Features:

- **Main View**: Displays a list of all movies with images, titles, and descriptions. Provides search functionality, movie selection for details, login/logout, and navigation to the profile view.

- **Single Movie View**: Presents detailed information about a single movie, including description, genre, director, and the option to add it to the user's favorites list.

- **Login View**: Allows users to log in using their username and password.

- **Signup View**: Enables new users to register with their username, password, email, and date of birth.

- **Profile View**: Displays user registration details, favorite movies, and allows users to update their information, remove movies from favorites, and even deregister.

### Optional Views & Features:

- **Actors View**: Provides information about different actors.

- **Genre View**: Displays data about a genre, including name, description, and example movies.

- **Director View**: Offers data about a director, including name, bio, birth and death years, and example movies directed by them.

- **Additional Features**: Additional features include sorting movies, creating a "To Watch" list, displaying related movies, and sharing movie information.

## Technical Requirements

To achieve the project's objectives, the following technical requirements are essential:

- The app must be a single-page application (SPA) with state routing for view navigation and sharing URLs.
- Users should be able to filter movies using a search feature.
- Parcel is used as the build tool.
- The app is built using React, written in ES2015+ syntax, and utilizes Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.
- The application employs function components and React Redux for state management of at least one feature (e.g., filtering movies).

## Getting Started
